# Getting started with webpack is easy

Using webpack on smaller projects is simple. It can be very useful in situations where you just want to hack on some proof of concept but you need some dependencies from NPM and also want to use the latest ESNext or TypeScript features. Lets try it out!

Make a new directory for your project and change into that directory

```shell
$ mkdir webpack-easy && cd webpack-easy
```

Initialize NPM via Yarn

```shell
$ yarn init -y
```

If you don't already have yarn it's very easy to install: [https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
